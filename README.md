Peer Reviewed by: Pedro Castaneda - Great effort! On the 1440 screen everything looks great and good job on the navbar links being at baseline. On the 1024 your columns overlap in the overview section. Also the text underneath the amenities icons offset to the left. Tablet version looks good, although the rewards images are too close together and the text in the packages section are all centered. You had some of the same issues with the smaller screens but you fixed some stuff as well. I think this was a very challenging project and overall you did good work! I liked how the inputs collapsed in the smaller screens too. Nice job!
